    "The result of the code will be: 1 2 8\n",
    "In the given code, there is a function named func that takes three arguments: a, b, and c. The argument b has a default value of 6, and the argument c has a default value of 8.\n",
    "When the function is called with the values func(1, 2), the value of a is set to 1, the value of b is set to 2 (overriding the default value of 6), and the value of c remains the default value of 8.\n",

    "therefore, when the function is executed, it will print 1 2 3, displaying the values of a, b, and c, respectively. The keyword arguments allow us to specify the values of b and c out of order while still correctly assigning them to their respective parameters\n",
