    "#Q1 What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. It is a color model used in digital imaging and computer graphics to represent colors as a combination of red, green, blue and an alpha channel, which controls the transparency of the color. The values for each color component and the alpha channel are usually represented as integers in the range of 0 to 255 or as floating-point values in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. This color model is commonly used in web development and design to specify colors for elements on a webpage or in a graphic design.\n",

    "#Q2 From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "To get the RGBA value of any image using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the getpixel() method. Here's an example:\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.png')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the RGBA value of a pixel at coordinates (x,y)\n",
    "pixel_rgba = image.getpixel((x,y))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the RGBA value\n",
    "print(pixel_rgba)\n",
    "\n",
    "The getpixel() method returns a tuple containing the RGBA value of the pixel at the specified coordinates. You can use this method to get the RGBA value of any pixel in the image by specifying its coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3 What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "A box tuple is a tuple that defines a rectangular region in an image or a drawing. It is commonly used in various Python libraries, such as Pillow, to specify the location and size of an image or a subregion of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pillow, a box tuple is a tuple of four integers that represents the left, upper, right, and lower coordinates of a rectangle, in that order. The left and upper coordinates specify the top-left corner of the rectangle, and the right and lower coordinates specify the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4 Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an\n",
    "Image object?\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an image object in Python using Pillow, you can use the size attribute of the Image class. Here's an example of how to load an image and get its width and height:\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the width and height of the image\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the width and height\n",
    "print(f\"The image width is {width} pixels and the height is {height} pixels.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we load the image file using the Image.open() method and assign it to the image variable. Then we use the size attribute of the Image class to get the width and height of the image and assign them to the width and height variables, respectively. Finally, we print the width and height using a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5 What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left\n",
    "quarter of it?\n",
    "To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the crop() method of the Image class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the original image\n",
    "original_image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the box tuple for the top-right three-quarters of the image\n",
    "box = (0, 0, 100, 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Crop the original image to the specified box\n",
    "cropped_image = original_image.crop(box)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the cropped image\n",
    "cropped_image.show()\n",
    "In this example, we first load the original image using the Image.open() method and assign it to the original_image variable. Then we define a box tuple that specifies the region to be cropped from the original image. The box tuple (0, 0, 100, 50) corresponds to the top-right three-quarters of the image. The first two values (0, 0) specify the top-left corner of the box, and the last two values (100, 50) specify the bottom-right corner of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6 After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "To save changes made to an Image object as an image file using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the save() method of the Image class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform some operations on the image, for example, resize it\n",
    "resized_image = image.resize((200, 200))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the modified image as a new file\n",
    "resized_image.save('resized_example.jpg')\n",
    "In this example, we first load the image file using the Image.open() method and assign it to the image variable. Then we perform some operations on the image, for example, resize it using the resize() method and assign the resulting Image object to the resized_image variable.\n",
    "Finally, we save the modified image as a new file using the save() method. The first argument to the save() method is the filename to save the image as. In this case, we save the image as 'resized_example.jpg'. The file format is automatically inferred from the file extension, so the file will be saved in JPEG format because the extension is .jpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7 What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "The ImageDraw module of the Pillow library contains the shape-drawing code. The ImageDraw module provides a 2D drawing interface for Image objects, allowing you to draw shapes such as lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, and text onto the image. You can create an ImageDraw object by calling the ImageDraw.Draw() function and passing in the Image object you want to draw on. Once you have an ImageDraw object, you can call its various methods to draw shapes and text onto the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q8 Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind\n",
    "of object?\n",
    "You can use the ImageDraw module in the Pillow library to draw shapes and text onto Image objects. The ImageDraw module provides a Draw object that has methods for drawing various shapes, such as lines, rectangles, circles, and polygons, onto an Image object.\n",
    "To get a Draw object, you need to create an ImageDraw object first by calling the ImageDraw.Draw() function and passing in the Image object you want to draw on as an argument."
