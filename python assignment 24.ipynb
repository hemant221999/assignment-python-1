    "Q1 What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Answer- The relationship between def statements and lambda expressions lies in their shared purpose of defining functions in Python. Although they serve the same fundamental purpose, there are some differences in their syntax and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "def statement: It is used to define a named function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing any arguments. The function body is indented below the def statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expression: It is an anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword, followed by the arguments (if any), a colon, and the expression to be evaluated. Lambda expressions do not have a function name and are typically used as one-liners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Naming:\n",
    "\n",
    "def statement: Functions defined using the def statement are assigned a name and can be called by using that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expression: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions and do not have an explicit name. They are usually assigned to variables or used directly as function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "Answer- Concise Syntax: Lambda expressions provide a compact and concise syntax for defining small, one-line functions. They allow you to define a function in a single line of code without the need for a def statement and a separate function name. This can make the code more readable and reduce the overall number of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymous Functions: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions, which means they do not require a function name. This is useful in situations where you need a function for a specific task or as a temporary or throwaway function. You can define the function inline at the point of use without cluttering your code with unnecessary function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-Order Functions: Lambda expressions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions such as map(), filter(), and reduce(). These functions accept other functions as arguments and lambda expressions provide a convenient way to define these functions on the fly. Using lambda expressions in combination with higher-order functions can result in more concise and expressive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "Answer- map(), filter(), and reduce() are three commonly used higher-order functions in Python that operate on iterables. Although they have some similarities, they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "map():\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: map() applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator that yields the results. It is used to transform every element in the input iterable by applying a function to it.\n",
    "Syntax: map(function, iterable)\n",
    "filter():\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: filter() creates an iterator that filters elements from an iterable based on a given function or condition. It returns the elements for which the function returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce():\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: reduce() performs a cumulative computation on an iterable by applying a function to the elements in a pairwise manner. It reduces the iterable to a single value.\n",
    "Syntax: reduce(function, iterable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 What are function annotations, and how are they used\n",
    "Answer- Function annotations in Python are a way to associate arbitrary metadata or type hints with the parameters and return value of a function. They provide additional information about the types or expected values of function arguments and the return type, although they do not enforce any runtime behavior or type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function annotations are defined using the colon (:) after the parameter name or return arrow (->) for the return value, followed by the annotation expression. The annotation expression can be any valid Python expression, including built-in types, user-defined types, or even strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "Answer- Recursive functions are functions that call themselves within their own body. They are a powerful technique in programming where a problem can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems that can be solved using the same function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions typically have two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: A condition that specifies when the recursion should stop. It defines the simplest possible case that can be solved directly without further recursion. The base case allows the function to exit the recursive loop and return a value.\n",
    "Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input. This step breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, making progress towards the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6 What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "Answer- \n",
    "When coding functions, following some general design guidelines can improve the readability, maintainability, and reusability of your code. Here are some important guidelines to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Purpose and Responsibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function should have a clear purpose and be responsible for a specific task. Functions should be focused and perform a single, well-defined operation. This promotes code modularity and makes functions easier to understand and test.\n",
    "Function Naming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use descriptive and meaningful names for functions that accurately convey their purpose. Choose names that are concise, yet expressive. This helps improve code readability and makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the function's functionality.\n",
    "Function Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit the number of parameters passed to a function to keep it manageable. Too many parameters can make functions harder to use and understand. If a function requires many parameters, consider grouping related parameters into data structures (e.g., dictionaries, named tuples) or using keyword arguments for clarity.\n",
    "Use type hints in function signatures to provide hints about the expected types of the parameters. This can improve code readability and help with code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7 Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "Answer- Functions in Python can communicate results to the caller through various mechanisms. Here are three common ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Statement: The primary way for functions to communicate results is by using the return statement. It allows a function to return a value or multiple values back to the caller. The return statement terminates the function execution and transfers the control back to the caller, along with the specified value(s). The caller can capture and use the returned value(s) as needed.\n",
    "Global Variables: Functions can modify or set the values of global variables, allowing them to communicate results indirectly. By updating global variables within a function, the caller can access the modified values after the function call. However, this approach should be used with caution, as excessive use of global variables can lead to code complexity and potential issues.\n",
    "Side Effects: Functions can communicate results by performing side effects, which means they modify the state of objects or perform actions without directly returning a value. Side effects can include printing output, writing to a file, updating a database, or modifying mutable objects that are passed as arguments. The caller observes the results indirectly by observing the changes in the environment."
