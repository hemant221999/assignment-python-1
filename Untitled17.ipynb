    "#Q1 How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "answer-shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() are functions in the Python Standard Library's shutil module used for copying files and directories, respectively. The key differences between them are:\n",
    "shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file from one location to another, while shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory and its contents to another location.\n",
    "shutil.copy() creates a new file in the destination directory with the same name as the original file, while shutil.copytree() creates a new directory in the destination location with the same name as the original directory and copies all files and subdirectories recursively into it.\n",
    "shutil.copy() preserves the file metadata (such as permissions, timestamps, and ownership), while shutil.copytree() can preserve metadata if the copy_function argument is used.\n",
    "shutil.copy() can overwrite an existing file in the destination directory, while shutil.copytree() cannot overwrite an existing directory in the destination location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file, while shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory and its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2 What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "answer-The os.rename() function is used to rename files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The os.rename() function takes two arguments: the current name of the file, and the new name for the file. Here is an example:\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# current name of the file\n",
    "old_name = \"old_filename.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# new name for the file\n",
    "new_name = \"new_filename.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# rename the file\n",
    "os.rename(old_name, new_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3 What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "answer- The send2trash and shutil modules both provide functions for deleting files and directories in Python, but they have some differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that send2trash moves files and directories to the operating system's trash or recycle bin, while shutil permanently deletes files and directories from the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4 ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is\n",
    "equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "answer- The equivalent method to the open() method for File objects in the ZipFile module is the ZipFile() constructor method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ZipFile() constructor method is used to create a new ZipFile object, which can be used to read or write to a ZIP archive. It takes two arguments: the filename of the ZIP archive, and the mode to open the archive in. The mode can be \"r\" to read an existing archive, \"w\" to create a new archive, or \"a\" to append to an existing archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of using the ZipFile() constructor method to open an existing ZIP archive for reading:\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "# open the existing ZIP archive for reading\n",
    "zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# perform operations on the ZIP archive\n",
    "\n",
    "# close the ZIP archive when done\n",
    "zip_file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the ZipFile() constructor method is used to open the existing ZIP archive \"example.zip\" in read mode ('r'). Once the zip_file object is created, we can perform operations on the ZIP archive, such as extracting files or reading their contents. Finally, we close the ZIP archive using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that just like File objects, it is recommended to use the with statement when working with ZipFile objects, which automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf\n",
    "or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer- Here's an example program that searches for files with a given extension (in this case, \".pdf\") in a folder and its subfolders, and copies them to a new folder:\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "# set the source folder and destination folder paths\n",
    "source_folder = '/path/to/source/folder'\n",
    "destination_folder = '/path/to/destination/folder'\n",
    "\n",
    "# set the file extension to search for\n",
    "file_extension = '.pdf'\n",
    "\n",
    "# create the destination folder if it doesn't already exist\n",
    "if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):\n",
    "    os.makedirs(destination_folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "# recursively search the source folder for files with the given extension\n",
    "for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_folder):\n",
    "    for file in files:\n",
    "        if file.endswith(file_extension):\n",
    "            # construct the full path of the source file\n",
    "            source_file_path = os.path.join(root, file)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # construct the full path of the destination file\n",
    "            destination_file_path = os.path.join(destination_folder, file)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # copy the file to the destination folder\n",
    "            shutil.copy(source_file_path, destination_file_path)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            print(f\"Copied file {source_file_path} to {destination_file_path}\")\n",
    "In this program, we use the os and shutil modules. We first set the paths of the source and destination folders, as well as the file extension we want to search for. Then, we create the destination folder if it doesn't already exist using the os.makedirs() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the os.walk() function to recursively search the source folder and its subfolders for files with the given extension. For each file found, we construct the full paths of the source and destination files using os.path.join(), and copy the file to the destination folder using shutil.copy(). Finally, we print a message indicating which file was copied to which location.\n"
