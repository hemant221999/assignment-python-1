    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to write a block of code that can be reused multiple times within a program. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, you can simply call the function whenever you need to perform that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularization: Functions help to break down a large program into smaller, more manageable modules. This makes the program easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions can provide a higher level of abstraction, which allows you to hide the details of how a particular task is implemented. This makes it easier to work with complex code, as you can focus on the overall functionality rather than the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Functions can be tested in isolation, which makes it easier to identify and fix bugs. By testing individual functions, you can ensure that each one works correctly before integrating them into the larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Functions make it easier to scale a program. As the program grows in size and complexity, functions can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the rest of the program. This makes it easier to maintain and extend the program over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The code in a function runs when it is called, not when it is specified.\n",
    "When you define a function in a program, you are essentially creating a blueprint for the function. The code inside the function will only run when the function is called from somewhere else in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following Python code:\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "result = add_numbers(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "In this code, the add_numbers function is defined with two parameters a and b. However, the code inside the function (return a + b) will only run when the function is called with specific arguments, as in the line result = add_numbers(3, 4).\n",
    "When the function is called with the arguments (3, 4), the code inside the function will execute and return the result 7. This result is then assigned to the variable result and printed to the console with the print function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(3)\n",
    "In most programming languages, a function is created using a function definition statement. The syntax for defining a function can vary depending on the programming language, but in general, the statement will have the following components:\n",
    "The def keyword, which indicates that you are defining a function.\n",
    "The name of the function, which should be descriptive of what the function does.\n",
    "A set of parentheses, which may or may not contain parameters or arguments that the function accepts.\n",
    "A colon, which indicates the beginning of the function body.\n",
    "The code or statements that make up the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(4)\n",
    "A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task when called or invoked. It is a reusable piece of code that can be executed many times in a program.\n",
    "A function call, on the other hand, is the actual execution of the function. It is the point in the program where the function is invoked and the code inside the function is executed with the arguments passed to it.\n",
    "In other words, a function is a definition of what the code should do when called, while a function call is the actual execution of that code with specific input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(5)\n",
    "In a Python program, there is only one global scope, which is created when the program starts running. This global scope is accessible from anywhere in the program, and any variables or functions defined in the global scope can be accessed from any part of the program.\n",
    "On the other hand, local scopes are created whenever a function is called. Each function call creates its own local scope, which is separate from the global scope. Any variables or functions defined within a local scope are only accessible within that scope and are destroyed when the function call is complete.\n",
    "It is important to note that local scopes can also be nested. This means that a function can be defined within another function, creating a new local scope within the outer function's local scope. In this case, the inner function can access variables from the outer function's scope, but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(6)\n",
    "When a function call returns, the local variables defined within that function's local scope are destroyed and their memory is freed. This means that any variables, objects, or data structures created within the function's local scope are no longer accessible once the function returns.\n",
    "This is because the local scope is created and destroyed every time the function is called and returned, respectively. The local variables only exist as long as the function is executing, and once the function returns, the local scope and all of its contents are destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(7)\n",
    "A return value is a value that a function sends back to the code that called it. When a function is called, it executes the code within its body and may return a value to the calling code. This value can be used by the calling code for further processing, assignments, or any other purposes.The return value is specified using the return keyword in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(8)\n",
    "If a function does not have a return statement, the return value of a call to that function will be None. None is a built-in Python object that represents the absence of a value.\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "result = greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "In this code, the greet function takes a parameter name, prints a greeting to the console, but does not return any value. The result variable is then assigned the value of the function call greet(\"Alice\"). Since the greet function does not have a return statement, its return value is None.Therefore, the output of the print(result) statement will be None. This is because result is assigned the return value of the greet function, which is None.It's important to note that even though a function may not explicitly return a value, it may still modify global variables or have side effects that affect the program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(9)\n",
    "In Python, you can make a function variable refer to a global variable using the global keyword.When you use the global keyword before a variable name within a function, it tells Python to use the global variable with that name instead of creating a new local variable. This allows you to modify or access the value of a global variable from within a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(10)\n",
    "In Python, None is a built-in constant object that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used as a default return value for functions that do not explicitly return a value.None is of type NoneType, which is a built-in type in Python. This means that it is its own data type, separate from other data types like strings, integers, or lists.\n",

    "The sentence \"import areallyourpetsnamederic\" is not a valid Python module or package, so if you were to try to run it as a Python command, it would result in a ModuleNotFoundError.In general, the import statement in Python is used to import modules or packages into your Python script or interactive session. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements that can be used in other Python code, while a package is a collection of modules that are organized hierarchically in a directory structure.\n",

    "If you had a bacon() function in a spam module, you would call it using the dot notation after importing spam.\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "Assume we have a spam module with a bacon() function defined in it:\n",
    "    def bacon():\n",
    "    print(\"I am bacon!\")\n",
    "We can then import the spam module into our main Python script and call the bacon() function using the dot notation:\n",
    "    import spam \n",
    "    spam.bacon()   \n",
    "In this example, we import the spam module using the import statement, and then call the bacon() function from the spam module using the dot notation (spam.bacon()). The output of this code will be \"I am bacon!\", since that is the message printed by the bacon() function when it is called.By using the dot notation to access the bacon() function, we can call it as a method of the spam module object that we imported into our script.\n",

    "There are several techniques that you can use to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error in Python:\n",
    "1)Use a try-except block: You can use a try-except block to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully in your code. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception, while the except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised. By using try-except block, your program can continue to run even if an error occurs.\n",
    "2)Use conditional statements: You can use conditional statements such as if and else to check for conditions that may cause errors in your program, and handle them accordingly.\n",
    "3)Use assertions: You can use assertions to check for conditions that must be true in your program, and raise an exception if they are not. This can help you catch errors early in your code and handle them before they cause more serious problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer(14)\n",
    "The try and except clauses are used together in Python to handle exceptions or errors that might occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "The purpose of the try clause is to define a block of code where an error might occur. It allows you to test a piece of code for errors without actually crashing your program. If an error occurs within the try block, Python will stop executing that block and move on to the except block.\n",
    "The purpose of the except clause is to define a block of code that will be executed if an error occurs within the try block. The except clause specifies the type of error that should be caught, and the code that should be executed when that error occurs."
