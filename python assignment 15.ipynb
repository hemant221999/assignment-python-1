    "#Q1 How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the\n",
    "number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).\n",
    "\n",
    "answer- To calculate the number of seconds in an hour using the interactive interpreter as a calculator, you can simply multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60). The calculation would be:\n",
    "60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there are 3600 seconds in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2 Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called\n",
    "seconds_per_hour.\n",
    "answer- To assign the result of the previous calculation (3600 seconds/hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour, you can simply write:\n",
    "seconds_per_hour = 3600\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3 How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour\n",
    "and minutes per hour.\n",
    "answer- To calculate the number of seconds in a day using the variables seconds per hour and minutes per hour, we can start by calculating the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds/hour) and then multiply it by the number of hours in a day (24 hours/day). The calculation would be:\n",
    "seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * 24\n",
    "Substituting the value of seconds_per_hour (which we previously calculated as 3600) into this formula, we get:\n",
    "seconds_per_day = 3600 * 24\n",
    "Simplifying this expression gives us:\n",
    "seconds_per_day = 86400\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4 Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day\n",
    "answer -to calculate the number of seconds in a day using the variables seconds_per_hour and minutes_per_hour and store the result in a variable called seconds_per_day, we can do the following:\n",
    "seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60  # 60 seconds in a minute times 60 minutes in an hour\n",
    "minutes_per_hour = 60\n",
    "seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * 24\n",
    "print(seconds_per_day)\n",
    "This will output 86400, which is the number of seconds in a day. The value 86400 will also be stored in the variable seconds_per_day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.\n",
    "answer -  To divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using floating-point division (/), we can simply write:\n",
    "seconds_per_day = 86400\n",
    "seconds_per_hour = 3600\n",
    "result = seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "24.0\n",
    "This means that there are 24 hours in a day (which we already knew), since seconds_per_day is exactly 24 times larger than seconds_per_hour. The result is a floating-point number because we used floating-point division (/) instead of integer division (//).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree\n",
    "with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?\n",
    "answer -  To divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using integer division (//), we can write:\n",
    " seconds_per_day = 86400\n",
    "seconds_per_hour = 3600\n",
    "result = seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "This is the same result as in the previous question, except that it is an integer instead of a float (since we used integer division instead of floating-point division).\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, this number agrees with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0.\n",

    "The genPrimes() function initializes a list of primes with the first prime number, 2, and yields it. It then tests successive odd integers starting from 3 for primality. If an integer is prime, it is added to the list of primes and yielded by the generator. If an integer is not prime, the generator moves on to the next integer to test.
