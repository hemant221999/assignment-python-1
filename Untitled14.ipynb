    "#Q1 What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer-In Python, the feature responsible for generating Regex objects is the \"re\" module. The \"re\" module provides support for regular expressions (also known as regex or regexp) in Python by compiling regular expressions into pattern objects, which can be used for pattern matching operations on strings. The main function used for creating a regex object in Python is the re.compile() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2 Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer- Raw strings are often used in Regex objects because they allow backslashes (\\) to be interpreted as literal characters instead of escape characters. In regular expressions, backslashes are often used to create special characters, such as \\d to match any digit character, or \\s to match any whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Python strings, backslashes are also used to create escape sequences, such as \\n for a newline character or \\t for a tab character. This can cause issues when using regular expressions in Python strings because the backslashes might be interpreted as escape sequences instead of regex special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this issue, raw strings (denoted with an r prefix) are often used for regular expressions in Python. Raw strings treat backslashes as literal characters, so they allow regular expressions to be written without worrying about escaping special characters. For example, the regular expression \\d can be written as r'\\d' in a raw string, and the backslash will be interpreted as a literal character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3 What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer-The search() method is a method of a regex object in Python, which is used to search for a regex pattern within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search() method returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string, and None if the pattern is not found. The match object contains information about the location and content of the match, such as the starting and ending positions of the match, the matched text, and any groups that were captured by the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4 From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "answer-To get the actual strings that match the pattern from a match object in Python, you can use the group() method of the match object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The group() method returns the string matched by the entire regular expression or by a specific group within the regular expression. If the regular expression contains one or more capture groups (defined by enclosing part of the pattern in parentheses), then you can pass the group number or name to the group() method to get the corresponding captured text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5 In the regex which created from the r&#39;(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
    "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "answer- In the regular expression created from the pattern r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', group 0 covers the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of three digits before the hyphen, and group 2 covers the second set of three digits before the hyphen and the four digits after the hyphen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6 In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "answer- In regular expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have special meanings, such as grouping and quantifying respectively. To match literal parentheses and periods in a regex pattern, you need to \"escape\" them using a backslash \\.\n",
    "To match a literal open or close parenthesis, you can use the escape sequence \\( and \\) respectively. Similarly, to match a literal period, you can use the escape sequence \\.. Here's an example:\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"The (quick) brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Or does it?\"\n",
    "pattern = r'\\(quick\\)|\\.'\n",
    "\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['(', 'quick', ')', '.', '.', '.', '?']\n",
    "In this example, the regular expression pattern r'\\(quick\\)|\\.' matches either the literal string \"(quick)\" or any single character (represented by a period). The backslash before the parentheses and period characters escapes them so they are treated as literal characters instead of special regex syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7 The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "the two options?\n",
    "answer- The findall() method in Python's regular expression module returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in a string. Whether it returns a list of strings or a list of tuples depends on whether the regular expression contains capturing groups or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the regular expression contains no capturing groups (i.e., no parentheses), findall() returns a list of strings, where each string in the list represents a match of the pattern in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q8 In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "answer- In standard regular expression syntax, the | character (vertical bar or pipe symbol) is used to specify an alternative pattern. It is called the \"alternation\" or \"OR\" operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The | character separates multiple patterns, any of which can be matched in the input string. For example, the regular expression cat|dog matches either the substring \"cat\" or the substring \"dog\" in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code using the | character:\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n",
    "pattern = r'fox|dog'\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)\n",
    "The output will be ['fox', 'dog'], because the regular expression pattern fox|dog matches either the substring \"fox\" or the substring \"dog\" in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q9 In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "answer -In regular expression syntax, the dot character . (period or full stop) is a special character called the \"wildcard\" or \"dot-all\" character. It matches any single character except for a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the regular expression a.b matches any three-character sequence where the first and third characters are \"a\" and \"b\", respectively, and the second character can be any character except for a newline. This would match strings like \"acb\", \"a#b\", \"a9b\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q10 In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "answer- In regular expression syntax, the + and * characters are quantifiers that specify how many times the preceding pattern should match. The main difference between them is:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.\n",
    "* matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.\n",
    "For example, the regular expression ab+ matches the substring \"ab\" followed by one or more occurrences of the letter \"b\". This would match strings like \"ab\", \"abb\", \"abbb\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q11 What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "answer- In regular expression syntax, the curly braces {} are used as quantifiers to specify how many times the preceding pattern should match. The difference between {4} and {4,5} is:\n",
    "\n",
    "{4} matches exactly four occurrences of the preceding pattern.\n",
    "{4,5} matches between four and five occurrences of the preceding pattern.\n",
    "For example, the regular expression a{4} matches exactly four occurrences of the letter \"a\". This would match strings like \"aaaa\" but not \"aaa\" or \"aaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q12 What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "expressions?\n",
    "answer- In regular expression syntax, the shorthand character classes \\d, \\w, and \\s are used to match specific types of characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\d matches any digit character (0-9).\n",
    "\\w matches any word character, including letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "\\s matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.\n",
    "For example, the regular expression \\d{3} matches any three consecutive digit characters, such as \"123\" or \"789\", while the regular expression \\w+ matches any sequence of one or more word characters, such as \"hello\" or \"world_123\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q13 What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "answer- In regular expression syntax, the shorthand character classes \\D, \\W, and \\S are used to match specific types of characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\D matches any character that is not a digit (0-9).\n",
    "\\W matches any character that is not a word character, i.e., not a letter, digit, or underscore.\n",
    "\\S matches any character that is not a whitespace character, i.e., not a space, tab, or newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q14 What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "answer- The regular expressions .* and .*? are similar in that they both match any sequence of zero or more characters. However, the ? character in .*? makes the * quantifier lazy, which means it will match as few characters as possible to satisfy the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q15 What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "answer-In regular expression syntax, you can use a character class to match a single character that is either a lowercase letter or a digit. To do this, you can use the square brackets notation and include the character ranges for the lowercase letters (a-z) and the digits (0-9) inside the brackets, like this:\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 123 times.\"\n",
    "pattern = r'[a-z0-9]+'\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)\n",
    "The pattern [a-z0-9]+ matches any sequence of one or more characters that are either lowercase letters or digits. The + quantifier ensures that the match includes all consecutive characters that belong to the same character class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q16 What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "answer- In regular expressions, you can make a pattern case-insensitive by using the re.IGNORECASE or re.I flag with the re.compile() function or with the re.match(), re.search(), and re.findall() functions.\n",
    "Here's an example using re.compile():\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy DOG.\"\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'dog', re.IGNORECASE)\n",
    "matches = pattern.findall(text)\n",
    "print(matches)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q17 What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "answer- In regular expressions, the . character normally matches any character except for a newline (\\n). However, if the re.DOTALL or re.S flag is passed as the second argument to the re.compile() function or to the re.match(), re.search(), or re.findall() functions, the . character will match any character including a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q18 If numReg = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;), what will numRegex.sub(&#39;X&#39;, &#39;11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4\n",
    "hen&#39;) return?\n",
    "answer- If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), then numReg.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') will return the string 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sub() method of a compiled regular expression replaces all non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern with the specified replacement string. In this case, the pattern r'\\d+' matches one or more digits, and the replacement string is 'X'. Therefore, all occurrences of digits in the input string will be replaced by 'X'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the input string '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen', there are four occurrences of digits: 11, 10, 5, and 4. Therefore, the output string will be 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q19 What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "answer -Passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allows you to create a regular expression with whitespace and comments for improved readability without affecting the pattern's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular expression, whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines are significant and can affect the pattern's meaning. Using re.VERBOSE flag enables you to add comments and white spaces to your regular expressions to make them more readable without affecting the pattern's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q20 answer - To match a number with commas for every three digits, you can use the following regular expression:\n",
    "^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "^ - matches the start of the string\n",
    "\\d{1,3} - matches 1 to 3 digits\n",
    "(,\\d{3})* - matches zero or more occurrences of a comma followed by exactly 3 digits\n",
    "$ - matches the end of the string\n",
    "This regular expression matches any number that starts with 1 to 3 digits, followed by zero or more occurrences of a comma and exactly 3 digits. It does not match numbers with less than 4 digits, or numbers with a comma after only two digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using this regular expression in Python:\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$')\n",
    "\n",
    "valid_numbers = ['42', '1,234', '6,368,745']\n",
    "invalid_numbers = ['12,34,567', '1234']\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in valid_numbers + invalid_numbers:\n",
    "    match = pattern.match(num)\n",
    "    if match:\n",
    "        print(f'{num} is valid')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f'{num} is invalid')\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q21 answer- To match the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe, with the conditions mentioned in the prompt, the following regex can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "^[A-Z][a-z]*\\sWatanabe$\n",
    "Explanation of the regex:\n",
    "\n",
    "^ : Matches the start of the string.\n",
    "[A-Z] : Matches the first character of the first name, which must be an uppercase letter.\n",
    "[a-z]* : Matches zero or more lowercase letters after the first character of the first name.\n",
    "\\s : Matches a single whitespace character.\n",
