    "#Q1 In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened?\n",
    "When working with the PyPDF2 library in Python, you should open the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() file objects in binary mode ('rb' for reading and 'wb' for writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    # Do something with the PdfFileReader object\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a new PDF file in write-binary mode\n",
    "with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as output_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileWriter object\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()\n",
    "    # Do something with the PdfFileWriter object\n",
    "    # (e.g. add pages to the PDF, write the PDF to disk, etc.)\n",
    "    pdf_writer.write(output_file)\n",
    "Note that when working with PyPDF2, it's important to open the PDF file in read-binary mode, even if you're only reading text from the file. This is because PDF files are binary files and contain non-textual data, such as images and fonts, that can be corrupted if the file is read as a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2 From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",
    " To get a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object, you can use the getPage() method of the PdfFileReader object, passing the zero-based index of the page you want to retrieve as an argument. Since the index is zero-based, you would pass 4 as the argument to getPage() to retrieve page 5.\n",
    " import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get a Page object for page 5\n",
    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Do something with the Page object (e.g. extract text from the page)\n",
    "    page_text = page_5.extractText()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print the text from page 5\n",
    "    print(page_text)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3 What PdfFileReader variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document?\n",
    "   The PdfFileReader object has a numPages variable that stores the total number of pages in the PDF document. You can access this variable to get the number of pages in the PDF document after creating a PdfFileReader object.\n",
    " import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get the number of pages in the PDF document\n",
    "    num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print the number of pages\n",
    "    print(\"Number of pages:\", num_pages)\n",
    "In this example, we open the PDF file 'example.pdf' in read-binary mode and create a PdfFileReader object called pdf_reader. We then access the numPages variable of the pdf_reader object and store it in a variable called num_pages. Finally, we print the number of pages in the PDF document using the print() function.\n",

    "#Q4 If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish, what must you do\n",
    "before you can obtain Page objects from it?\n",
    "   If a PdfFileReader object's PDF is encrypted with a password, you must decrypt the PDF before you can obtain Page objects from it. In this case, you can use the decrypt() method of the PdfFileReader object to decrypt the PDF by passing the password as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the encrypted PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "with open('example_encrypted.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Decrypt the PDF using the password 'swordfish'\n",
    "    pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get a Page object for page 5\n",
    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Do something with the Page object (e.g. extract text from the page)\n",
    "    page_text = page_5.extractText()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print the text from page 5\n",
    "    print(page_text)\n",
    "In this example, we open the encrypted PDF file 'example_encrypted.pdf' in read-binary mode and create a PdfFileReader object called pdf_reader. We then use the decrypt() method of the pdf_reader object to decrypt the PDF using the password 'swordfish'. After the PDF is decrypted, we can retrieve the Page object for page 5 using pdf_reader.getPage(4) and perform operations on it as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5 What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n",
    "  You can use the rotateClockwise() and rotateCounterClockwise() methods of a Page object to rotate a page in a PDF document. These methods allow you to rotate a page by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get a Page object for page 5\n",
    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise\n",
    "    page_5.rotateClockwise(90)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise\n",
    "    page_5.rotateCounterClockwise(90)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6 What is the difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object?\n",
    "   In Python's python-docx library, a Run object and a Paragraph object are two different types of objects that are used to represent different elements in a Word document.\n",
    "A Paragraph object represents a single paragraph in a Word document. It contains a list of one or more Run objects that represent the formatted text within the paragraph. A Paragraph object may contain multiple Run objects if the text within the paragraph has different formatting applied to different sections.\n",
    "A Run object, on the other hand, represents a contiguous run of text within a paragraph that has the same formatting applied to it. For example, if a paragraph contains the text \"This is some bold text.\", the paragraph would contain a single Run object for the entire text string. However, if the same text string was formatted to have the first three words in bold and the last two words in italics, then the paragraph would contain two Run objects - one for the bold text, and one for the italicized text.\n",
    "In summary, a Paragraph object represents a single paragraph, and contains one or more Run objects that represent the formatted text within the paragraph. A Run object represents a contiguous run of text within a paragraph that has the same formatting applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7 How do you obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object that’s stored in a variable\n",
    "named doc?\n",
    "To obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object stored in a variable named doc using the python-docx library, you can use the paragraphs attribute of the Document object. The paragraphs attribute returns a list of all the Paragraph objects in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the Word document in read mode\n",
    "doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get a list of all the Paragraph objects in the document\n",
    "paragraphs = doc.paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the text of each paragraph in the document\n",
    "for paragraph in paragraphs:\n",
    "    print(paragraph.text)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q8 What type of object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables?\n",
    "   The Font object in Python's python-docx library has variables for bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline. The Font object represents the formatting of a Run object in a Word document.\n",
    "   import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the Word document in read mode\n",
    "doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the first paragraph in the document\n",
    "paragraph = doc.paragraphs[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the first run in the paragraph\n",
    "run = paragraph.runs[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the formatting of the run\n",
    "font = run.font\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the run is bold\n",
    "if font.bold:\n",
    "    print('This run is bold')\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q9 What is the difference between False, True, and None for the bold variable?\n",
    "    In Python's python-docx library, the bold attribute of the Font object is a boolean variable that indicates whether the text is formatted to be bold or not. Here's how False, True, and None affect the formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "False: If the bold attribute is set to False, the text is not formatted to be bold.\n",
    "True: If the bold attribute is set to True, the text is formatted to be bold.\n",
    "None: If the bold attribute is set to None, the text inherits the bold setting from the style hierarchy. If the style of the text is not explicitly set to be bold or not, it will use the default behavior of the style.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q10 How do you create a Document object for a new Word document?\n",
    "   To create a Document object for a new Word document using Python's python-docx library, you can simply call the Document() function with no arguments. This creates a new, empty Word document that you can add content to programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new Word document\n",
    "doc = docx.Document()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add content to the document\n",
    "doc.add_paragraph('This is the first paragraph.')\n",
    "doc.add_paragraph('This is the second paragraph.')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the document\n",
    "doc.save('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q11 How do you add a paragraph with the text &#39;Hello, there!&#39; to a Document object stored in a\n",
    "variable named doc?\n",
    "    To add a paragraph with the text 'Hello, there!' to a Document object stored in a variable named doc using Python's python-docx library, you can use the add_paragraph() method of the Document object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an existing Word document\n",
    "doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new paragraph to the document\n",
    "doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the document\n",
    "doc.save('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q12 What integers represent the levels of headings available in Word documents?\n",
    "  In Word documents, there are nine levels of headings available, each represented by a unique integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 1: 0\n",
    "Level 2: 1\n",
    "Level 3: 2\n",
    "Level 4: 3\n",
    "Level 5: 4\n",
    "Level 6: 5\n",
    "Level 7: 6\n",
    "Level 8: 7\n",
    "Level 9: 8\n",
    "These integer values are used when specifying the level of a heading in Python's python-docx library, for example, when using the add_heading() method of the Document object."
